This GitHub repository hosts code and resources for a machine learning project aimed at detecting Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using various techniques such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression (LR). Leveraging Federated Learning (FL) for data privacy and security, the project trains and evaluates models on datasets sourced from multiple sources, targeting accurate ASD diagnosis for both children and adults. The repository includes data, notebooks, scripts, and results, allowing users to explore, preprocess, train, and assess machine learning models' performance. Contributions are welcome, and the project is licensed under the MIT License. For further details, installation instructions, and usage guidelines, please refer to the README.md file.
